# Portfiolio-Project-Covid19-SQL
SQL Queries for Covid-19 Dataset

## Project Overview
This is my first SQL project as I study data analytics. I followed a tutorial by **Alex the Analyst** and explored COVID-19 data. Throughout this project, I encountered so many challenges and errors, but they helped me learn a lot about writing and troubleshooting SQL queries. 

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project contains COVID-19 data , including cases, deaths, and vaccination statistics. The dataset was downloaded from **Our World In Data**. The data was cleaned (a bit) using Excel and analyzed using SQL.
The dataset used in this project can be accessed here:  
[COVID-19 Data on Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/15GZ661HdK-UlaUswSL_ZibOUuP7se6uQ?usp=sharing)  

## Skills & Concepts Covered
- Data exploration and retrieval
- A bit of data cleaning
- Data validation and transformation
- Aggregate and Window functions 
- Joins and subqueries
- Common Table Expressions (CTEs)
- Views
- Temp Tables
- CASE statements and partitioning
- Statistical and Analytical Queries

## Files in This Repository
- `Portfolio_Project_Covid19_SQL_Analytics` - Contains all SQL queries used for data analysis.
- `README.md` - Project documentation.

## Lessons Learned
- Gained a better understanding of how to structure complex queries.
- Learned how to debug errors and make queries more efficient.
- Realized the importance of cleaning data before analysis to get accurate results.

## Acknowledgment
Special thanks to **Alex the Analyst** for the tutorial that guided me through this project.

## Notes
Please excuse some of the comments in the SQL fileâ€”they were added as personal notes to help me track my progress, findings, and thought process during the analysis
