# Portfiolio-Project-Covid19-SQL
SQL Queries for Covid-19 Dataset

## Project Overview
This is my first SQL project as I study data analytics. I followed a tutorial by **Alex the Analyst** and explored COVID-19 data. Throughout this project, I encountered so many challenges and errors, but they helped me learn a lot about writing and troubleshooting SQL queries.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project contains COVID-19 data , including cases, deaths, and vaccination statistics. The dataset was downloaded from **Our World In Data**. The data was cleaned (a bit) using Excel and analyzed using SQL.

## Skills & Concepts Covered
- Data exploration and retrieval
- Data cleaning, validation, and transformation
- Aggregate and Window functions 
- Joins and subqueries
- Common Table Expressions (CTEs)
- Views
- Temp Tables
- CASE statements and partitioning
- Statistical and Analytical Queries

## Files in This Repository
- `Portfolio_Project_Covid19_SQL_Analytics` - Contains all SQL queries used for data analysis.
- `covid_deaths_cases` - Table that contains Covid-19 data
- `vaccinations` - Table that contains Covid-19 data
- `README.md` - Project documentation.

## Lessons Learned
- Gained a better understanding of how to structure complex queries.
- Learned how to debug errors and make queries more efficient.
- Realized the importance of cleaning data before analysis to get accurate results.

## Acknowledgment
Special thanks to **Alex the Analyst** for the tutorial that guided me through this project.
